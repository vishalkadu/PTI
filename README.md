#### Features

volatile acidity : Volatile acidity is the gaseous acids present in wine. fixed acidity : Primary fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic

residual sugar : Amount of sugar left after fermentation.

citric acid : It is weak organic acid, found in citrus fruits naturally.

chlorides : Amount of salt present in wine.

free sulfur dioxide : So2 is used for prevention of wine by oxidation and microbial

spoilage. total sulfur dioxide

alcohol : Percent of alcohol present in wine. 

sulphates : Added sulfites preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and
bacteria.

pH : In wine pH is used for checking acidity
density.

###Final Project 2: 
#### In this, We will predict the price of the Gold.

##### Features:

This data file is a Comma separated value file format with 2290 rows and 7 columns.

It contains 5 columns which are numerical in datatype and one column in Date format.

Clearly the data shows value of the variables SPX,GLD,USO,SLV,EUR/USD
against the dates in the date column

We will create a model with the following steps:

 Import the relevant packages

 Explore the dataset

 Prepare the dataset for training

 Use any prediction algorithm based upon the EDA

 Train the model to fit the data

 Make predictions using the trained model

 Create a test case and generate a predicted
